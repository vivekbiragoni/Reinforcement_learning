## Introduction

In this project, we've implemented an RL agent capable of challenging the Stockfish engine in a game of chess. The agent employs Q-learning with function approximation to develop a strategic policy for making moves on the chessboard.

## Dependencies

Before diving in, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

- [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/): A Python library for chess.
- [stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/): An open-source chess engine.
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm): A fast, extensible progress bar for Python.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/): A powerful library for mathematical operations in Python.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): A versatile plotting library.

Install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install python-chess stockfish tqdm numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

Let's get started:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivekbiragoni/Reinforcement_learning
cd Reinforcement_learning
```

2. Install the dependencies.

3. Execute the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Reinforcement_learning_chess.ipynb
```

## RLAgent Class

The core implementation of the RL agent resides in the `RLAgent` class within `Reinforcement_learning_chess.ipynb`. This class includes methods for Q-value management, action selection, reward calculation, and gameplay.

## Training

The training loop runs for a specified number of episodes. In each episode, the agent engages in a chess match against Stockfish, updating Q-values based on the rewards acquired during the game.

## Results

Upon execution, the notebook provides insights such as the number of wins, losses, and draws, along with average rewards and rewards per episode. Additionally, visualizations may be present to showcase the learning progress.

## Acknowledgments

This project draws inspiration from the exciting field of reinforcement learning, showcasing the practical application of Q-learning in a chess-playing agent.
